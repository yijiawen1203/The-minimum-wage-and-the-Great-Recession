the code here aims to replicate the following paper: **Clemens, J., & Wither, M. (2019). The minimum wage and the Great Recession: Evidence of effects on the employment and income trajectories of low-skilled workers. Journal of Public Economics, 170, 53-67.**

1. I first download the code from the following website: https://www.nber.org/research/data/survey-income-and-program-participation-sipp

  After downloading the 2008 sipp data, use the stata to transform the data into csv file. 

  then use python to process the data.

2. to replicate figure 1, I need to get the minimum wage by state at 2008. I search and get the minimum wage data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lislejoem/us-minimum-wage-by-state-from-1968-to-2017?resource=download

  the downloaded file is: 1_Minimum Wage Data by state.csv

  next I use ArcGIS to visualize the panel 1 in figure 1. The output file is figure1_minimum wage bounded map.pdf. The process path is "D:\1_yogafile\3_FSU\2022fallCourse\appliedECO\minimumWage" (for myself reference).

  we can see the replication figure is almost the same.
